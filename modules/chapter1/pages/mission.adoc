= Your Place in the Adventure

Welcome, AI Operator! As you prepare to validate model accuracy, let's look at how this fits into the bigger picture. This course is a key mission in your learning adventure to master the "AI Factory"â€”a system where you control the balance between **Performance, Accuracy, and Cost**.

=== Your Mission Log

This entire learning path is a series of missions. Having established a performance baseline, your objective now is to understand the quality of your model.

* **Mission 1: Benchmark the Battlefield with GuideLLM**
* **This Mission: Validate Your Ally's Strength with lm-eval-harness**

A fast model that gives wrong answers is useless. Your task here is to get a hard, data-driven baseline of your model's accuracy, answering the question: "Is this model smart enough for my application?"

* **Mission 3: Tune Your Engine with vLLM Optimization**
* **Mission 4: Travel Light and Fast with LLM Compressor**

=== The Rules of Engagement

A quick piece of intel: these labs are blueprints, not paint-by-numbers exercises. They are based on real-world patterns from successful customer engagements. You will be starting with a standard, resource-limited OpenShift AI environment.

Your challenge is to **adapt these blueprints**. You will have to think like an operator, figuring out how to make these tools work within your constraints to achieve your goals.

Now that you understand the mission, it's time to learn how to measure a model's true capabilities. Let's get started with setting up the Trusty AI environment.
