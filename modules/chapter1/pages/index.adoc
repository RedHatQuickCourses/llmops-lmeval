= Evaluating Model Accuracy with lm-eval-harness

== Introduction to Model Accuracy Evaluation

Welcome to the course on Evaluating Model Accuracy. While our previous course focused on system performance, this course will teach you how to answer an equally critical question: "Is the model *correct*?"

A fast model is great, but it's only half the story. A model that is fast but inaccurate doesn't just fail to add value—it can actively create risk for the business. This course will teach you how to measure a model's *task-level accuracy* and *reasoning capabilities* using standardized, data-driven methods.

=== Why Accuracy Evaluation Matters

While performance metrics like latency and throughput are critical for an efficient service, task-level accuracy is essential for delivering a *valuable* and *safe* one. Here’s why this evaluation is a cornerstone of LLMOps:

. **Selecting the Right Model:** How do you choose between Model A and a fine-tuned Model B? A higher price or larger parameter count doesn't guarantee better performance on your specific task. Accuracy benchmarks give you the hard data needed to make an informed, cost-effective decision.

. **Validating After Optimization:** You've just learned how to tune and quantize models to make them faster and cheaper to run. But did that optimization degrade the model's quality? Running accuracy evaluations before and after optimization is the only way to ensure you haven't sacrificed correctness for speed.

. **Building Trust and Ensuring Safety:** Before deploying a model in a customer-facing or mission-critical application, you must be confident in its reliability. Formal evaluation helps identify weaknesses, biases, or gaps in a model's knowledge, which is a critical step in risk management.

. **Justifying Investment (ROI):** For fine-tuning projects, you need to prove that the investment of time and resources resulted in a tangible improvement. A higher accuracy score on a relevant business benchmark is the clearest way to demonstrate ROI.

=== What is lm-eval-harness?

**lm-eval-harness** is a widely adopted, community-maintained benchmarking toolkit from **EleutherAI**. It provides a standardized framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) across dozens of academic benchmarks, ensuring consistent and reproducible results. It can test models on tasks ranging from question answering and common sense reasoning to complex, multi-subject examinations.

=== What is Trusty AI?

https://trustyai.org/docs/main/main[TrustyAI^,window="_blank"] is Red Hat's open-source AI explainability and trustworthiness platform. Within OpenShift AI, Trusty AI provides an enterprise-ready, operator-based way to run evaluation frameworks like `lm-eval-harness`. It simplifies the process of running evaluation jobs in a secure and manageable way.

=== What is MMLU-Pro?

**MMLU-Pro** is a reasoning-focused, multiple-choice benchmark derived from the original https://huggingface.co/datasets/cais/mmlu[MMLU dataset^,window="_blank"]. MMLU-Pro extends the original MMLU benchmark by introducing 10-option multiple-choice questions across diverse academic disciplines. It's designed to test a model's **reasoning, factual recall, and elimination skills**—key for enterprise AI.
